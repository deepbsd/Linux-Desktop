# Linux-Desktop

This will be a website dedicated to using Linux as a desktop solution for productivity

My personal background is with being a developer and a technical writer.  The only thing I have been using Windows for is gaming,
and that is simply because I like Call of Duty.  My tastes in gaming are rather boring, or else I'd be interested in trying the
growing world of Linux gaming.

For now, since I came to programming as a passion rather late in life, my main concern is getting good as a programmer.  Vim is my
primary editor--it's very powerful--and I also have a passion for the UNIX lifestyle that grew up around me in my youth.
